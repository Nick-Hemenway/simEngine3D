# simEngine3D
General 3-Dimensional Physics Engine in Python

### How to use:
The primary module that needs to be imported to use the code is `simEngine3D.py`
which contains the definition of a `System` class. To begin, the user always
instantiates a system. From there the user can call the various system methods
to create new bodies as well as constraints between the bodies.

The folder `Examples` contains examples that will execute and have output when run.
This folder will contain run files that will show the working functionality required
by each homework in ME751.

# Notes:
### Notation:
A combination of CamelCase and underscore notation is used throughout the code.

CamelCase is used for class names only.

Underscores are used for methods and attributes.
